# ![investwithabira_cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ed9aae3-64d7-45d0-99ef-8f3057364b83)

#### Established in 2012, ABIRA Securities Ltd. is a Kolkata-based stock broking house that belongs to GTFS. GTFS is one of the largest and strongest players in the distribution of financial products like Mutual Funds, Microfinance, Insurance Awareness, and auxiliary services (both life and general), having 303 branches across India and over a million individual marketing associates. We provide the NSE and BSE platforms for trading and CSDL for Depository services.

## Project Goals
#### Abira Securities has applied for a mutual fund (MF) license from the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), as securities firm is waiting for the nod from SEBI  meanwhile it is collecting data about products available in mutual fund industries having some of the key elements like AMC name,  Scheme Name, Fund manager, Return’s of funds in 1 year, 3 years and 5 years. However, the data is currently unrefined and underutilized, presenting both challenges and opportunities for unlocking valuable insights.
In cleaning and analyzing Adidas's data, meaningful insights can be extracted from the dataset to support the company’s teams—like sales, product, and marketing. By providing actionable data insights, our aim is to improve distribution efficiencies and drive better decision-making for advisors to sell ideal mutual fund to customers, ultimately helping Abira securities to optimize its processes of distribution, deliver products, and fill the gaps in industry where the fellow competitors are lagging.

## Stakeholder Questions
1.	Can we get a detailed analysis of mutual funds by category? What are the key trends and insights for each category?
2.	What does the AMC landscape look like in terms of risk levels, scheme ratings, and returns? Which AMCs are performing best across these metrics?
3.	Is there a direct correlation between high-risk mutual funds and high returns? How should we interpret this relationship?
4.	How are the top fund managers performing? Can we identify any standout performers and their impact on returns?
5.	What does the return analysis reveal for each mutual fund category? Which categories are delivering the best results over different periods?

## Executive Summary
#### The mutual fund analysis reveals critical insights for the business development team. Equity funds dominate with 37% of all schemes, offering the highest returns over 3 and 5 years (29.74% and 12.07%, respectively), while solution-oriented funds represent the lowest share at 3%. ICICI Prudential leads among 39 AMCs in fund size and scheme count, with Quant achieving the highest average rating of 4.5. Top-performing fund managers like Vishal Mishra and Rahul Goswami drive significant returns and manage large fund sizes. Hybrid and Debt categories average a 3-star rating, with Debt funds excelling in 1-year returns (5.55%). Risk analysis highlights over half of the schemes as high-risk, with Equity funds showing the best Sharpe and Sortino ratios, reflecting superior risk-adjusted returns. These findings underscore opportunities to focus on high-performing categories and AMCs while managing portfolio risks effectively.
